                    # Fat-Poached Carnitas * 3 pounds of boneless pork shoulder or
                    uncured picnic ham (see note for how to select). * 0.25 to 0.50 cups
                    of liquified fat (oil, lard or duck fat is acceptable) * 10 to 15
                    garlic cloves (roasted preferred) * 1 lemon, sliced into thin
                    circles and those are quartered * coarse salt * black pepper 1. Heat
                    oven to 250 degrees. 2. Cube pork shoulder in roughly 3-inch chunks.
                    3. Salt and pepper the cubes aggressively. 4. Stuff cubes tightly
                    (very tightly) into the smallest, deepest baking dish available. 5.
                    Stuff garlic and lemon between the cubes. 6. Pour fat over cubes to
                    just cover. 7. Bake in oven for 5 hours. 8. Remove dish from oven.
                    9. Cover a sheet pan with foil. 10. With slotted spoon, remove the
                    pork to the sheet pan and spread out in a single layer. 11. Turn on
                    broiler. 12. Broil pork in sheet pan until it is somewhat blackened
                    and crispy, probably 4-6 minutes. YMMV because broilers are
                    ridiculous. 13. Remove from oven and tease with fork. ## Notes * A
                    nice thick fat cap on the top of the pork is preferable. * Ask your
                    butcher to remove any bones. * Do not use cured meat.
